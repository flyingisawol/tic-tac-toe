### The Planning Process:
I began by sketching a wireframe for the app (below) and from there began coding to move toward a working game. I kept a running sheet (to-do list) to help keep me on track and oriented toward a finished product, and maintained a list of items achieved and those that remained outstanding. I used standups as a way of setting clear intentions each day and setting my aim for the day to come.
